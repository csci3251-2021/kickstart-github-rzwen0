# Skills Learned in This Course
To be Honest, the first time I take in this workship, I just been confused by what is going on. But now I realize that this workship is actually useful.
## Virtual Desk, Ubuntu and Linux system
It's quite annoyed that a 1 units pf course got everyweek take home exercise. But it actually lead me to some use full skill I never know.
## Self Learning and Practice
Somnetimes I can't understand TA, so when the ddl is coming I have to google and pracive myself. I think that's also an important skill.
