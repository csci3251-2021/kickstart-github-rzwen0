HELLO Everyone, welcome to may profile, thanks for your attention.
I am WEN Ruizhe, a student from mainland who have join CUHK in 2019 and studying Computer Science now. 
I decide to study CS is because I am very interested in creating something that can move itself. 
In university my favorite course is the programming language course and coding skill course. 
And my hateset is all UG course(just course, I like teachers indeed), and I don't like totally math course.
In live I will paly some video game if I am free. May be I will buy a PS6 when I can earn money by myself.
All in all it is just a brief profile, just let you know something of me. That's me, a common university student.
